Utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle, our team will employ Tableau to craft interactive and insightful visual representations. This approach aims to elucidate trends, patterns, and disparities in the H1B application landscape, facilitating a deeper understanding for stakeholders and interested parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject B : Documents Authentication Test\n\nPipline\n\n\n\n\nIn this project, our objective is to establish tokens to conduct documents authentication: 1. Conducted words and signatures detection, extraction and normalization of 1472 documents then stored and encrypted them in AWS S3 as Trusted Authentication Tokens of digital documents; 2. For signature tokens, created a signature verification system to verify customers’ signatures by establishing a Transfer Learning model using Siamese Neural Network in AWS SageMaker; 3. For word tokens, built a changed word test system utilizing tokenization and word searching skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe structure of transfer learning model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
